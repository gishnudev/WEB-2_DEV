<!-- Question 2: Fitness Activity Tracker (30 marks)
Objective:

Create a Fitness Activity Tracker application where users can add, edit, complete, and remove fitness activities. Each activity should have a name and an intensity level (1-Low, 2-Medium, 3-High). The application should use type conversion and arrays to manage the activities and their intensity levels.

Requirements:
a) HTML Structure (5 marks)
Create an input field for the activity name.
Create an input field for the intensity level (1-Low, 2-Medium, 3-High).
Add a button to add the activity.
Include an unordered list to display the activities.
b) Adding and Displaying Activities (10 marks)
In JavaScript, implement a function to add an activity with its name and intensity level.
Use arrays to keep track of activities and their intensity levels.
Use type conversion to ensure the intensity level input is handled correctly.
Display activities with different colors based on their intensity level:
Low (green)
Medium (orange)
High (red)
c) Completing and Editing Activities (5 marks)
Implement functionality to mark an activity as "completed" by striking through the text and changing the color to gray.
Implement functionality to edit the name of an activity.
d) Removing Activities and Local Storage (10 marks)
Implement functionality to remove an activity from the list.
Use localStorage to persist the activity list between sessions. -->
